# Admin Dashboard

This is my final project for the Intermediate HTML and CSS course from The Odin Project. The goal was to use CSS Grid as a layout, with minimal Flexbox. I ended up challenging myself to use only CSS Grid, although for future projects I plan to use a combination of these two layout methods. Plus, I took this opportunity to have some fun with the design.
